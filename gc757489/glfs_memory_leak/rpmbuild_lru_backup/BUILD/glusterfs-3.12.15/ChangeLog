    afr: prevent winding inodelks twice for arbiter volumes
    
    Backport of https://review.gluster.org/#/c/glusterfs/+/21380/
    
    Problem:
    In an arbiter volume, if there is a pending data heal of a file only on
    arbiter brick, self-heal takes inodelks twice due to a code-bug but unlocks
    it only once, leaving behind a stale lock on the brick. This causes
    the next write to the file to hang.
    
    Fix:
    Fix the code-bug to take lock only once. This bug was introduced master
    with commit eb472d82a083883335bc494b87ea175ac43471ff
    
    Thanks to  Pranith Kumar K <pkarampu@redhat.com> for finding the RCA.

    cluster/afr: Delegate metadata heal with pending xattrs to SHD
    
    Problem:
    When metadata-self-heal is triggered on the mount, it blocks
    lookup until metadata-self-heal completes. But that can lead
    to hangs when lot of clients are accessing a directory which
    needs metadata heal and all of them trigger heals waiting
    for other clients to complete heal.
    
    Fix:
